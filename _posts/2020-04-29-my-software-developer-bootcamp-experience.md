title: My Software Developer Bootcamp Experience

---
I've always enjoyed solving problems. A day where I am bouncing round fighting proverbial fires and figuring out how best to solve issues has always been more enjoyable for me than doing the same thing over and over again.

I also love to tinker and fix things. Can I make that a little bit faster? Can I make this look nicer? How can get that from 6 steps down to 3?

So I took some time out and decided what I wanted to do with my career. What would make me feel fulfilled. The answer?

Software Development.

Fast forward a few weeks and I enrolled in CodeClan's "Professional Software Developer" course. An intense 16 week course of Ruby, Java and Javascript along with various other topics to break these up a little.

I knew very little about how to write software. I'd considered myself a somewhat capable web developer before hand when in reality, I knew some basic CSS and HTML. I could change the colour of a text block or create a hyperlink, but I knew nowt about Javascript or anything else. I had however, always been **very** interested in technology.

I’m going to use a cliche here but bear with me. CodeClan was a roller-coaster but not your typical roller-coaster. There were very little ups and downs for me, so in that regard it was like a very specific roller-coaster. This one.

The course was **intense** and fast paced. We would begin at 9:15 and keep going until between 4-5 in the afternoon. We would then get our homework and start coding again. We’d collect in little groups and work through the problems together and teach other, then we’d go home and keep working on the code. I was up until 1am on several occasions working out how the hell to get something working.![](/uploads/tenor.gif)  
If that sounds intense, it’s because it is. This image is fairly accurate

That 5% of the time you feel like a god? That’s incredible. That’s the buzz that just doesn’t come from any other job. I’ve worked in professional sport before and I get a bigger high from finally figuring out a problem than I ever did by winning a football match.

The actual course itself is very well put together. It taught me things I didn’t even realise I was learning at the time and I had a common refrain I think I might have repeated too much in morning stand-ups but here it is again for old times sake.

> “Last week was so much easier than this week”

That’s true every single week and looking back now I can recognise all the big and small things I learned. I have a pretty good grasp now of those three languages but the most important thing I took away from the course was learning how to learn. I can pick up new languages now, in fact, I’m now coding merrily away in Swift after taking a few weeks to learn the basics there.

I firmly went from a closed mind-set to an open mindset. My mind is now more open than, well, theres a quarantine on just now so not much is open but you get my point. I wasn’t sacred by Swift, I just dove right in. I have the confidence and faith to do that with any language (COBOL?).

I also wanted to touch on the human aspect of this experience. My Cohort graduated 4 days before lockdown and our final week was done remotely. I expected us all to go our separate ways but we’ve all stayed in touch. We still have regularly social evenings over zoom, our WhatsApp group remains very active and we share new learnings all the time. We even still do stand up every morning and we support each other through a unique time. Our instructors are part of that too. They’ve all moved on to their next projects and cohorts but they still make the time to speak to us. My point here is we don’t do this because we have to, we do it because we want to. There’s a bond there that brings us all together and I’m very grateful it exists. We’re all planning to go and get matching tattoo’s once it’s safe to do so.

My advice to anyone considering doing one of these courses is go for it. It’s changed my life it far more ways than I ever thought it would and I am very grateful to my cohort, my instructors and CodeClan.

I’m very please to say that I **am** a Software Developer and always will be.
