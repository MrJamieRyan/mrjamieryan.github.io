# This site

Before I graduated CodeClan, I started trying to get myself a website online. jamieryan.dev has gone through about 5 different iterations over the last few months and this might look like I can’t settle but in reality there’s a far more practical reason and that is to gain experience.

Each time the website has changed over the last few months it’s because I’ve deployed it onto a completely different host with a different tech stack behind it.

So far I’ve deployed on

* Wordpress hosted on a VPS
* Gatsby with Ghost CMS hosted on Netlify
* Squarespace

I wanted to gain as much experience as possible because now that I’m a fully fledged developer, more people are asking me to build them websites and I want to find a good balance of maintainability for me and ease-of-use for them. 

Each one of these is very different and has their benefits and drawbacks. I won’t go into these here as I think they’re very subjective.

# Reading and watching and listening

Every day I also do a lot of content consumption. I watch videos, read books and listen to podcasts on various subjects in the world of development. I even play games (More of that later)

Here are some of my favourite things to consume when I’m doing housework or something else.

* [CharliMarieTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/charlimarieTV) - Charli is a web designer from New Zealand but living in Spain, she shares some fantastic tips and products and is refreshingly honest about what it’s like to be a designer. Her most recent video at time of writing is a detailed look at salaries which is rare in this industry from what I’ve seen.
* [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/user/DesignCourse) - Lot’s of different CSS and web design tips in this one. I’ve already solved a couple of problems I’ve had just by watching these videos.
* [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) - This a bi-weekly podcast from Wes Bos and Scott Tolinsky. They cover everything from deep dives into one subject to “pot-luck” episodes where listeners can ask quick questions. Again, I’ve picked up so many little nuggets from these guys, including a pretty big one I’ll go into shortly.
* [Apple's Swift Books](https://books.apple.com/gb/book/the-swift-programming-language-swift-5-1/id881256329) - Apple created Swift around 5 years ago and since the very start have made it as easy as possible for people to learn swift. They make all of the learning materials free and they are **very** well written.
* [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/uk/swift/playgrounds/) - This is a game for learning Swift. It starts off a little easy and it’s definitely aimed at kids but if you want a nice, calming intro to Swift then I cannot recommend this enough. If CodeClan was the river rapids of learning development this is like floating on a lazy river.

# Designing

I care about how things look and how they work. UX and Design is very important to me and I think it’s what makes the difference between a good product and a WOW product. Great products get used and put away, they don’t garner a second thought, but a well designed product with a good UX. They make the user **want** to use them. It keeps them coming back.

Design is almost treated as a mythical beast though, it’s something you're born with, something only a few people can do. **Nonsense**. I strongly believe that you can learn almost anything by paying attention, deconstructing (both mentally and physically) and by building and building and building.

My Mac at the moment is full of designs I’ve been working on for various different websites, apps and even physical products. I’ve been doing deep dives on this with some of my favourite products and hopefully I can share more later.

This has confirmed to me that I am definitely more of a front-end dude.

# JavaScript

I sharpen my Javascript skills by doing Wes Bos’ [Javascript30 Course](https://javascript30.com/). I’ve built DrumKits, Clocks and all sorts. It’s been really enjoyable and the course is FREE! I highly recommend this for anyone looking for Javascript projects to build.

I definitely find building things helps consolidate my learning a lot quicker than theory and there is no greater buzz than when you get something working.

# Swift

Ah Swift, how I love thee. I’ve only been learning it for a month or so but boy have I enjoyed it. String Interpolation? Be still my beating heart. 

I feel like I just “get” Swift so far and I look forward to making some apps with it in the future.

I’ve been doing the [100 Days of SwiftUI – Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course (also FREE) and it’s been very enjoyable. I try and stick to the curriculum as much as possible (it’s only around an hour a day) but quite often I’ll open a Swift Playground in Xcode and have a play with what I’ve learned.

# The Future

I have undoubtedly unlocked the ability to learn again and I haven’t felt this way since I was a kid. I’m having so much fun and importantly, getting so much fulfilment from exploring all of these technologies. 

When I think back to where I was before CodeClan it’s like night and day. Even since graduating I’ve learned so much on top of that again. 

I have no plans to slow down.
