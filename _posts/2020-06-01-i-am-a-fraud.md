I’m a fraud.

I’ve been affected by Imposter Syndrome for as long as I can remember. It’s not pleasant, all this crippling self doubt. Nothing in and of itself has caused me to be this way but I always expect anything good to end very shortly. Someone is going to come and tell me to pack it all up and move on, you’ve been faking this for long enough now, the party is over, it’s time for me to go home.

That hasn’t happened. I know _objectively _it’s not likely to happen. Yet, the fear remains.

I’ve just been offered a job in my new chosen field of software development. A job which could not have been more squarely aimed at my skill-set if I had written it myself. Yet I’m still convinced they offered it to the wrong person. There was another Jamie it was meant to go to and now they're trying to find a way out of it (They’re not, I have absolutely no real reason to feel that’s the case)

It doesn’t just affect my work, it affects my personal life too. I feel like my partner is with me through some sort of mistake, or admin error. Any day now she’ll wake up and realise she can do so much better than this idiot.

I feel like nobody likes me for me, they like me because of some unwritten and unspoken social construct that tells them to. Because you can’t actually go full Malcolm Tucker levels of honesty on someone. When they part company, they think of how weird I am, how I’m not one of them.

Even my dog should probably be taken away from me. Why? I have no idea, I love him dearly and take care of him better than I take care of myself, yet I still wait for the day the SSPCA knocks on my door with a travel crate, ready to take him away to his “real” home.

This way of thinking makes me behave in ways I would rather not. I actually really dislike alcoholic drinks, I’ve never been a fan and yet I drink because it’s socially unacceptable not to drink. You don’t get asked out and aren’t seen as being as fun if you don’t drink. I’ve never smoked or done drugs, I’ve got a very hard line with both of those, but drinking is something my peers can make me do. I also dislike most pubs and clubs. They are noisy, sticky, warm and I can never understand a word anyone is saying, so I try and laugh at what seems like an appropriate moment and then make an excuse and leave, I have become a master of the irish exit.

How does all this manifest itself? I have trouble believing anything is for the long term. I’ve realised this year that I have commitment issues. Not to people, I have people in my life who I love dearly and would take a bullet for and I have my wonderful partner who I adore with all my heart. But to situations.

* Made plans with me? I expect you to cancel them
* Ordered something nice online? The order will be cancelled, the item out of stock.
* Enjoying a TV show? It will get cancelled before the story is complete.

These things rarely happen of course and I **know** this at the time and even afterwards and yet I can’t help but feel it.

Bad things do happen. Pandemics hit, jobs are lost, people leave for one reason or another. All the while I need to convince myself on a daily basis that I have any clue what I’m doing or that I deserve anything remotely pleasant that comes my way.

Am I really a fraud? No, but convincing myself is **way** harder than convincing everyone else.
