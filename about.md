---

I am a software developer from Edinburgh, Scotland. In a past life I bounced between everything from startups to large companies until I discovered what I was good at. Building things digitally. I write here about pretty much everything.

I graduated from CodeClan digital skills academy which gave me an excellent foundation in coding and how to live life as a developer and since then I have expanded to several new projects and lanaguages.
