title: About
---

I am an agile Software Developer with a passion for learning and crafting memorable experiences. I have a technical mindset and my personal values are kindness and honesty. My goal is to continue growing my skills and using them to have a positive impact on the world.

I spent years of my life working for various different companies until I finally found a career that satisfied me. I'm now a full stack software developer building awesome products.

I decided to change career and enrolled in the CodeClan digital skills academy here in Edinburgh and I've never looked back. It's been the making of me as a human being.
