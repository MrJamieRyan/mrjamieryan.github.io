# Computer

I use a 13 inch Macbook Air. It’s the 2019 model with the true tone display. I quite like the keyboard but I am not a fan of it’s reliability issues. Thankfully Apple has extended this to 4 year coverage, which is a nice to have but I am hoping I never need it. I love everything else about this machine. It's light, fast and the perfect size.

# On My Desk

I use a 24 inch 4K monitor made by Electriq. This monitor was an absolute bargain. I can't go back to non-retina displays now and this was a great way maintain the resolution without parting with too much cash.

I really like the Rain mStand and before I pulled the trigger on it I was browsing through Amazon Basics and they do a very similar stand. It's not _quite_ as well designed but it does the same job just as well.

I type on a Tecknet mechanical keyboard. There's just something so satisfying about clicky keys. I'm not at the stage yet where I'd call myself a mechanical keyboard enthusiast but I can definitely see why this happens.

I use an old bluetooth speaker as my audio out and a magic mouse as my mouse. I also have various POP! figures.
