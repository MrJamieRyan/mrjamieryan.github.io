### Computer

I use a base model 13 inch Macbook Air (2019). I love everything about this machine. It's light, fast and the perfect size.

I haven't had any issues with the keyboard (yet?) but Apple has extended the coverages to 4 years, which is a nice to have but I am hoping I never need it.

### On My Desk

I use a 28 inch ASUS VP28UQ 4k Monitor. It came with a very nice height adjustable stand which also tilts into vertical mode which is really handy when looking at a large code base.

I really liked the Rain mStand and before I pulled the trigger on it I was browsing through Amazon Basics and they do a [very similar stand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00WRDS0AU/ref=twister_B014HAMLEG?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1). It's not _quite_ as well designed but it does the same job just as well for a third of the price.

I type on a Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic. I obviously use a keyboard for both work and play and so I need to make sure it's not going to cause me longterm damage. This Keyboard is the comfiest I've ever used. It took me around a week to get used to typing on it. 

My headphones are Anker Soundcore Life 2's. They are wireless, noise cancelling and comfy. And they cost less than Â£50. Are Bose and Sony better? Sure. Are they 6 times better, justifying the price? Not for me.

All of this stuff is connected to an Uni 8 port dock. It has USB-C power pass through, HDMI, Ethernet, SD and Micro-SD card readers and 3 USB ports. IT also comes in a lovely little rubber case and the whole thing is just excellent quality. I love it.

I also have various POP! figures around my desk.

### Software

#### Firefox

I tried Firefox again a couple of months ago and I've stuck with it. It's really nice and the dev tools are better than Chrome. It's got all the extensions I need and has the added benefit of not eating RAM like it's at a hotel buffet.

#### Todoist

This is my to-do app of choice. I run everything through Todoist, from personal to work to a list if trips we want to go on and odd-jobs around the house etc. It syncs with my calendar which means when I have an appointment, I can add tasks subtasks to that appointment in Todoist, making sure I'm prepared.

#### Spotify

2 reasons that keep me on Spotify:

1\. the ability to play a song from my phone to my Amazon Echo's without fiddling with bluetooth.

2\. The oceans of user playlists. These are great for movie or tv show soundtracks or pretty much anything else.

#### Overcast

This is where I listen to podcasts. The voice boost and smart speed features mean I can squeeze in more podcasts than when played at normal speed. I normally have podcasts at 1.2x with both enabled.

#### VS Code

I started with Atom and whilst that's good, VS code has just improved my life as a developer by an order of magnitude. It does everything I need. In fact, this webpage and this very text was edited and posted from VS Code. My favourite extensions are

* Bracket Pair Colorizer 2: This color co-ordinates brackets. My biggest flaw as a developer is typo's. I frequently miss out a closing bracket or something and this lets me see at a glance where I have opened and closed brackets.
* Intellicode: Wonderful. Auto completes functions and variable names and so much more.
* Prettier: I always try and right clean code and readable code because I'm not a monster, but this makes it even better. If you wanted you could probably right all in one line and Prettier is smart enough to clean it all up (please don't do that).

#### Figma

Great for wireframes and sketching out ideas and sharing them.

#### Webflow

A GUI builder that requires no code. Sure, I could code this all by hand but why would I when this makes it so much easier?

#### Zoom

It gets decried on the internet a lot, but it's held up very well during the pandemic and it has some features that a lot of service don't have and are now copying, like grid view.

#### OctoTree Pro

A great little extension for add a tree view on the left hand side of a github repo. Why this isn't native in Github on large viewports is beyond me.
