### Computer

I use a 13 inch Macbook Air. It’s the 2019 model with the true tone display. I quite like the keyboard but I am not a fan of it’s reliability issues. Thankfully Apple has extended this to 4 year coverage, which is a nice to have but I am hoping I never need it. I love everything else about this machine. It's light, fast and the perfect size.

### On My Desk

I use a 28 inch ASUS VP28UQ 4k Monitor. It came with a very nice height adjustable stand. It also tilts into vertical mode which is super hand when looking at a large code base. 

I really like the Rain mStand and before I pulled the trigger on it I was browsing through Amazon Basics and they do a [very similar stand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00WRDS0AU/ref=twister_B014HAMLEG?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1). It's not _quite_ as well designed but it does the same job just as well for a third of the price. 

I type on a [Tecknet mechanical keyboard](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TeckNet-Mechanical-Keyboard-Anti-ghosting-Aluminum/dp/B010IIKHBK/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2BXC2T3X6GB7&dchild=1&keywords=tecknet+keyboard&qid=1588105939&s=computers&sprefix=tecknet+%2Ccomputers%2C162&sr=1-2). There's just something so satisfying about clicky keys. I'm not at the stage yet where I'd call myself a mechanical keyboard enthusiast but I can definitely see why this happens to people.

I also have a Logitech K380 which could not be any different from the above keyboard. It's bluetooth, has circular keys and is virtually silent when typing. It can also pair to 3 devices and switch between them at the touch of a button which is super handy when switching between personal and work laptops.  

My mouse is a Logitech MX Master. This mouse feels like it was made for me. It just fits in my hand perfectly. I love the side scroll wheel, forward and back buttons and the extra button in the thumb rest. I have that mapped to mission control. 

My headphones are Anker Soundcore Life 2's. They are wireless, noise cancelling and super comfy. And they cost less than £50. Are Bose and Sony better? Sure. Are they 6 times better, justifying the price? Not for me. 

All of this stuff is connected to an Uni 8 port dock. It has USB-C power pass through, HDMI, Ethernet, SD and Micro-SD card readers and 3 USB ports. IT also comes in a lovely little rubber case and the whole thing is just excellent quality. I love it. 

I also have various POP! figures around my desk.

### Software

#### Firefox

I tried Firefox again a couple of months ago and I've stuck with it. It's really nice and the dev tools are better than Chrome. It's got all the extensions I need and has the added benefit of not eating RAM like it's at a hotel buffet. 

#### Todoist

This is my to-do app of choice. I run everything through todoist, from personal to work to a list if trips we want to go on and oddjobs around the house etc. It syncs with my calendar which means when I have an appointment, I can add tasks subtasks to that appointment in todoist, making sure I'm prepared. 

#### Spotify

This is just what I use for Music. There's nothing special about Spotify except for the oceans of playlists which are great. One reason that keeps me on Spotify though is the ability to play a song from my phone to my Amazon Echo's without fiddling with bluetooth. 

#### Overcast

This is where I listen to podcasts. The voice boost and smart speed features mean I can squeeze in more podcasts than when played at normal speed. I normally have podcasts at 1.2x with both enabled. 

#### VS Code

I started with atom and whilst that's good, VS code has just improved my life as a developer by an order of magnitude. It does everything I need. In fact, this webpage and this very text was edited and posted from VS Code. My favourite extensions are

* Bracket Pair Colorizer 2: This color co-ordinates brackets. My biggest flaw as a developer is typo's. I frequently miss out a closing bracket or something and this lets me see at a glance where I have opened and closed brackets.
* Intellicode: Wonderful. Auto completes functions and variable names and so much more.
* Prettier: I always try and right clean code and readable code because I'm not a monster, but this makes it even better. If you wanted you could probably right all in one line and Prettier is smart enough to clean it all up (please don't do that).

#### Figma

Great for wireframes and sketching out ideas and sharing them.

#### Webflow

A GUI builder that requires no code. Sure, I could code this all by hand but why would I when this makes it so much easier?

#### Zoom

It gets decried on the internet a lot, but it's held up very well during the pandemic and it has some features that a lot of service don't have and are now copying, like grid view.

#### OctoTree Pro

A great little extension for add a tree view on the left hand side of a github repo. Why this isn't native in Github on large viewports is beyond me.
