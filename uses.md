# Computer

I use a 13 inch Macbook Air. It’s the 2019 model with the true tone display. I quite like the keyboard but I am not a fan of it’s reliability issues. Thankfully Apple has extended this to 4 year coverage, which is a nice to have but I am hoping I never need it. I love everything else about this machine. It's light, fast and the perfect size.

# On My Desk

I use a 24 inch 4K monitor made by Electriq. This monitor was an absolute bargain. I can't go back to non-retina displays and this was a great way maintain the resolution without parting with too much cash.

I really like the Rain mStand and before I pulled the trigger on it I was browsing through Amazon Basics and they do a very similar stand. It's not _quite_ as well designed but it does the same job just as well.

I type on a Tecknet mechanical keyboard. There's just something so satisfying about clicky keys. I'm not at the stage yet where I'd call myself a mechanical keyboard enthusiast but I can definitely see why this happens.

I use an old bluetooth speaker as my audio out and a magic mouse as my mouse. I also have various POP! figures around my desk.

# Software

I'm pretty boring with most of this, because I use nearly all of Apple's default apps. They work, they sync up and until one of them gives me a great reason to change, I'll stick with them. Having said that, there are a few things Apple doesn't provide, such as

<h2>VS Code</h2>

I started with atom and whilst that's good, VS code has just improved my life as a developer by an order of magnitude. It does everything I need. In fact, this webpage and this very text was edited and posted from VS Code. My favourite extensions are

- Bracket Pair Colorizer 2: This color co-ordinates brackets. My biggest flaw as a developer is typo's. I frequently miss out a closing bracket or something and this lets me see at a glance where I have opened and closed brackets.

- Intellicode: Wonderful. Auto completes functions and variable names and so much more.

- Prettier: I always try and right clean code and readable code because I'm not a monster, but this makes it even better. If you wanted you could probably right all in one line and Prettier is smart enough to clean it all up (please don't do that).

<h2>Figma</h2>

Great for wireframes

<h2>Webflow</h2>

A GUI builder that requires no code. Sure, I could code this all by hand but why would I when this makes it so much easier?

<h2>Zoom</h2>

It gets decried on the internet a lot, but it's held up very well during the pandemic and it has some features that a lot of service don't have and are now copying, like grid view.

<h2>OctoTree Pro</h2>

A great little extension for add a tree view on the left hand side of a github repo. Why this isn't native in Github on large viewports is beyond me.
